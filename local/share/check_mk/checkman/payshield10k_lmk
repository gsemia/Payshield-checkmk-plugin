 The check "Payshield LMK Info 1" and "Payshield LMK Info 2" .... are created dynamically for each loaded LMK. It provides an overview over the corresponding LMK slot and its details

 Each of these checks provides as Output of check plugin:

 "LMK {ID} {NAME} {KEYCHECKVALUE}"

 - loaded 1

 - Auth 2

 - NumAuthActivities: 0

 - Scheme: "Variant"

 The check Payshield LMK Num Old Loaded is OK as long as there are 0 old lmk loaded and is in WARN state if at least one old lmk is loaded. This may be neede for migrations but is dangerous if an old LMK is loaded for longer time.

 The check Payshield LMK Num Test Loaded is always OK and reports how many LMK in mode "test" are loaded.
